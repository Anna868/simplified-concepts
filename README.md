# simplified-concepts
## Personal Motivation for this repo:
The best way to learn anything is to explain it to someone else and iterate over the process till you solidify your understanding of the topic you are learning. (https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/).

In the spirit of learning "correctly", I decided that every now and then I would create very simplified versions of concepts related to a topic I am currently studying (e.g. Quantum Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics & physics, Software Workflows, etc.) intended for people with zero know-how on these topics.

I will benefit, and others might get interested. So stay tuned, I would appreciate the feedback !

## Content structure:
For each concept that is going to be presented in this repo, there will be:
1. A markdown file mimicing a blog post in which the concept is explained in layman terms without much complications or jargon.
2. A references folder containing further reading materials (e.g. textbooks, scientific papers, or even lecture notes from freely offered courses).
3. Practical code implementation of the concept being discussed, if coding is applicable in demonstrating the concept

## Recommendations for the viewers of this repo:
1. If you are a beginner reader regarding any concept presented here, my recommendation for you is to never stop at the intuitive explanations provided here. But rather use these simplified explanations to build a big picture understanding before you dive in more rigorous resources.
2. If you are an expert reader regarding any concept presented here, I encourage you to add your insights or correct any mistakes in the intuitive explanations to build a more useful repo and of course you will be properly attributed as a contributor to this repo.

I hope you find this idea useful, enjoy reading and studying and stay curious :)
